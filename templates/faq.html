In this fun and inspirational environment, participants will walk away with the confidence and knowledge to build something on their own!

            We will also cover design thinking, a creative framework that teaches participants to ideate empathetically, think fiercely, and bring their ideas to life. We will practice brainstorming, prototyping, and exchanging feedback with the class. This fun and creative workshop will inspire participants of all skill levels.
