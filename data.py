Think about it: how often have you conducted user research without actually talking to real people?
All too often we use data to infer what users want without ever asking them firsthand. According to Forrester Research's 2015 Customer Experience Index, 73 percent of businesses cite customer experience as a strategic priority, yet only 1 percent of companies deliver excellent customer experiences.
This session will equip you with the tools you need to understand your customers and make smarter product decisions though a Minimum Viable Testing (MVT) approach. With a defined MVT you can ensure that you are designing the best possible experience for your users.
In this session you will learn how to:
* Myth-bust the idea that research is expensive & delays product development
* Evaluate and choose the right research method for your project based on where you are in the product lifecycle
* Define research objectives as well as choose the right audience and tools
* Plan user research on a budget
* Collaborate with your core team to organize findings into themes and create actionable insights
* Effectively communicate research findings and priorities to stakeholders""",
